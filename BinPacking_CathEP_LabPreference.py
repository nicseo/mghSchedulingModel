This script models efficient scheduling of prime time procedures in both Cath and EP based
on data taken over a 125 day (25 week) period. The constraints of the model are:
    1. Room location (where the procedure must be done)
    2. Scheduling horizon (the time period during which the procedure must be scheduled)

Notes about use:
- You must have openpyxl package installed to run this script.

- The first part of this script sets up the necessary functions to carry out the analysis.
    At the bottom of this file, in the __main__ function, there are defined some variables
    that the user should verify before running the script (e.g. regarding the csv that the
    data is being read from).

- Results are output to an Excel sheet, whose workbook name and sheet must EXIST and
    be specified before running the script. Make sure the sheet is in the same directory
    as this script.

- Overflow procedures that are emergencies/same day procedures are listed during the day they
    were supposed to be scheduled. Overflows that were supposed to be scheduled within a week
    are listed in the first day of the week's overflows (Monday).
    
- If you change the number of Cath/EP rooms in the scheduling parameters, it is recommended
    that you CLEAR the output file of contents AND formatting before running.
